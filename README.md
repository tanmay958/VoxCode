# Code Voice Explainer

A VSCode extension that explains your code using AI and converts the explanations to natural speech using Murf.ai TTS. Perfect for learning, code reviews, and accessibility.

## Features

- üé§ **Voice Explanations**: Get your code explained in natural, conversational voice
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent code analysis
- üéØ **Code Highlighting**: Highlights the specific code being explained
- üì± **Interactive UI**: Beautiful webview panel with audio controls
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Customizable explanation detail levels and voice settings
- üíæ **Save Audio**: Export explanations as MP3 files

## Requirements

Before using this extension, you'll need:

1. **OpenAI API Key** - For code explanation generation (Required)
2. **Murf.ai API Key** - For premium text-to-speech conversion (Optional)

**Note:** If you don't have a Murf.ai API key, the extension will automatically fall back to OpenAI's TTS service, which is more widely available.
